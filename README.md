# CX - C Extended

[[![CI](https://github.com/doleckijakub/cx/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)]](https://github.com/doleckijakub/cx/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Notice

This project is still under development and at the moment only supports a small subset of planned features, don't use it in production yet.

<!-- ## Introducing CX

Unleash the Power of C, C++, and C# with Seamless Performance!

CX is a programming language that combines the best of C, C++, and C# without compromising performance. Designed for developers seeking the ultimate fusion of functionality and speed, CX's innovative compiler translates your code into native C, unlocking limitless possibilities.

Rocket Performance: With CX, you get the raw power of C, versatility of C++ and the elegance of C#. Experience lightning-fast execution and unleash your code's true potential without sacrificing efficiency.

Seamless Integration: CX effortlessly bridges the gap between languages. Not only does it already have familiar C-like syntax, it's also able to seamlessly interact with existing C, C++, and C# codebases, empowering you to build upon your existing projects and libraries.

Dynamic Code Generation: The CX compiler generates optimized C code, implementing non-native C functionality on the fly, tailoring it specifically to your needs.

Extensible Feature Set: CX offers an extensive range of features derived from C, C++, and C#, allowing you to leverage familiar constructs. From low-level memory management to high-level abstractions, CX empowers you to build anything from embedded systems to robust applications with ease.

Developer-Friendly Experience: CX maximises simplicity and ease-of-use. Unleash your creativity and build remarkable projects with a language designed by developers, for developers. -->

## Quick start

Below is an example of how a `test.cx` file can be translated to `test.c` and then compiled with gcc.

```console
$ make
$ ./cx test.cx -o test.c
$ gcc test.c -o test
```
